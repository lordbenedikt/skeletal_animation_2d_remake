  abstract  = {Usual way of character's animation is the use of motion captured data. Acquired bones' orientations are blended together according to user input in real-time. Although this massively used method gives a nice results, practical experience show how important is to have a system for interactive direct manipulation of character's skeleton in order to satisfy various tasks in Cartesian space. For this purpose, various methods for solving inverse kinematics problem are used. This paper presents three of such methods: Algebraical method based on limbs positioning; iterative optimization method based on Jacobian pseudo-inversion; and heuristic CCD iterative method. The paper describes them all in detail and discusses practical scope of their use in real-time applications.},
